# Console Finances

## Description

This is the fourth challenge in the bootcamp that focus on analysis the provided 
financial records and calculate the datasets which will be displayed in the 
console log.

This was a rather challenging task for me because I wasn't sure what code to use
to obtain the datas requested. It forced me to seek ourside sources in a more efficient
manner and also taught me how to use the array function: reduce to turn large sets of values into
a single value.
